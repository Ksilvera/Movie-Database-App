Movie Database app

Allows users to enter a title in the search bar and will return results below the search bar. Users can then click the title and view the movie description and rating.

Possible Improvements in the future:
    - Filter option
    - Suggested searches
    - Add to list button or favorites movie
    - Add links to netflix or other sites to be able to watch it?
